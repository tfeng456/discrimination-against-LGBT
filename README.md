# discrimination-against-LGBT
(Please see our project slides for in-depth descriptions of methodology and conclusions.)

## Research Questions
How might factors contribute to the discrimination of LGB* individuals?

Specifically, how does oneâ€™s gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, whether one is openly LGBT on social networks, perception of societal acceptance, perception of how friendly a major organization is towards LGBT individuals, level of support of pro-LGBT actions and policies impact discrimination against LGB* individuals?

Additionally (for all other predictors held constant), does the effect of sexual orientation on percent score of discrimination vary by ethnicity?

_Those who identified as transgender were excluded from our analysis due to an insufficient number of observations. As such, our analysis only applies to lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals._

## Methodology
Through exploratory data analysis, multiple regression, and investigation of interaction effects, we were able to derive insights into the above research questions.

## Conclusions
We found that the amount of discrimination an LGB individual experiences is influenced by their sexual orientation, whether that person is out on social media, by actions that support the LGBT community and by how friendly major organizations are to LGBT individuals. 

Lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals are met with implicit bias. Ethnicity also possibly adds another layer of bias, as observed in our interaction plots.
